Topic: A Web 3.0 based Crowdfunding Application
Name: HelpingETHS

## Inspiration:
A crowdfunding platform serves as a way for individuals or organizations to raise funds for
their projects, business ventures, or charitable causes from a large pool of donors, usually via
the internet. It provides an accessible and convenient avenue for those who lack traditional
funding sources, such as loans or grants, and allows them to reach a broader audience.
Crowdfunding also provides a way for people to invest in causes or projects that they believe in and to feel a sense of ownership or involvement in the success of those initiatives.

## Brief Idea:

A React based web application which allows a user to:
* Create A Crowdfunding Misison
* Donate to a Mission
* Get all the amount in Ethereum without any deduction
Also, a mission is given tags automatically like medical, education, etc.

## Tech Stacks
* React
* Solidity
* Hardhat
* Material-UI
* Thirdweb
* Polygon
* MetaMask

## Challenges
* Integrating blockchain modules with web application
* Using new techs like Hardhat and Thirdweb
